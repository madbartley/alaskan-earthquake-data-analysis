A data analysis of the last ten years of reported earthquakes in Alaska. Data taken from earthquake.alaska.edu

A week before I was supposed to fly to Alaska for a family cruise through the Inside Passage, a major earthquake caused tsunami warnings across the state. After doing some research, I found that Alaska experiences earthquakes frequently, and has experienced some of the largest tsunamis of the last century. 

Given the current climate crisis, I wanted to know if earthquakes in Alaska were being affected by the changes. I looked at Alaskan earthquake data over the past ten years, such as magnitude, frequency, and location to see if I could identify meaningful changes over the dataset.
